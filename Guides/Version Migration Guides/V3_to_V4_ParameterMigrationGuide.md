# LDAR-Sim V4 Parameter Migration Guide

## Purpose

This guide is intended to assist users who wish to update to LDAR-Sim V4 by providing instructions on transferring as much of the existing V3 parameters to V4 format. Do note that new behavior has been introduced in V4 and some existing behavior has been changed, thus, it is impossible to transfer all parameter files and inputs.

## What changed between V3 and V4

The majority of the LDAR-Sim parameters from V3 still exist in V4, but many of them have been renamed or reworked. Some parameters have been removed entirely. There are many new input files users can provide to define the modelled infrastructure in more granularity and previously existing input files have mostly been removed or reworked.

## Guidance on moving from V3 to V4

When moving from V3 to V4, it is advised to read the updated [user manual](../../USER_MANUAL.md) to get an initial understanding of the scope of all the changes that have occurred. Users will need to make new input files in order to run V4 simulations: Critically users will need a [sites file](../../USER_MANUAL.md#sites-file) and the new [emissions file](../../USER_MANUAL.md#emissions-file) to run any simulations. Many parameters have been changed or renamed. Reference the [Parameter File Changes](#parameter-file-changes) section for more detailed information. It may be easier for users to attempt to parameterize the V4 parameters while referencing the user manual for aid instead of attempting to "migrate" V3 simulation parameters.

## Input Files

### Unchanged Input Files

The weather file has remained unchanged from V3 to V4.

### Infrastructure

A new, much more granular infrastructure design has been introduced. See [infrastructure](../USER_MANUAL.md#infrastructure) and [virtual world defining files](../USER_MANUAL.md#10-virtual-world-defining-files) sections in the user manual for more information.

### Emissions File (New to V4)

New to V4 is a new file called the Emissions Fie. This file is mandatory to run any V4 simulations. Read more about it in the User Manual [here](../USER_MANUAL.md#emissions-file). It must be set in the virtual world parameters, see the relevant section [here](../USER_MANUAL.md#emissions_file).
